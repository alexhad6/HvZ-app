Requirements Analysis


For a list organized by feature, not priority, see here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qHi2_8F6LE2rxlUjYnn3yCerkZcWkR7JRCBPkTmQcE/edit


[USERS] = This idea came from a suggestion or idea by the users during our Requirements Elicitation Session. 
To see further details on which user said what, see the meeting notes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYI26Ps1jIxizjsSNAF72zXqXW7d-n8bNhIAPheYqrw. 
All other requirements came from our brainstorming session (https://github.com/alexhad6/HvZ-app/blob/master/Administrative/Phase%201/reqts_1c.txt).


Value: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW] = The tag for the relative value of the requirement, where HIGH is necessary for gameplay,
				 MEDIUM is not necessity for gameplay but would make game play slightly less effective, 
				and LOW is nice to have but not necessary
Confidence: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW] = The tag for the relative confidence of our assessment of the requirement. 
Difficulty: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW] = The tag for the relative difficulty to implement the requirement
Priority: [MH (must have) / SH (should have) / NH (nice-to-have)] = The tag for the priority of each requirement. 
									They are also listed in order of priority.  


----------- = This line marks the cut off for what we will try to create in the first draft of the product


1. Code is clear, readable, and documented so that mods can maintain and change the app in the future.
   * Value: [HIGH] The app should be usable after we go
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] We should be doing this already, but this can be challenging and time consuming. 
   * Priority: [MH] This is very critical to creating a good usable product for us, and for future editors.
2. Mods can start, end, and reset an HvZ game.
   * Value: [HIGH] Moderators need to manage the game. 
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Lots of interfacing with servers and resetting all data in the app 
   * Priority: [MH] The app should be usable over multiple games. 
3. Players can register for the game and create an account.
   * Value: [HIGH] We must be able to keep track of distinct players to play and get them in the system.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] None of us have worked with databases before.
   * Priority: [MH] We can’t run the game or test it without having players registered.
4. Players can log into their accounts.
   * Value: [HIGH] They must have access to their distinct account and stats
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Integrating a verification system might prove to be difficult.
   * Priority: [MH]: Need to keep track of players and have players access their own data.
5. There is an admin login for the mods, with a different UI.
   * Value: [HIGH] Mods need a way to manage the game.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] There are a lot more options that we need to include for the moderators. 
   * Priority: [MH] Mods must be able to edit the game in ways that players can’t
6. Zombie players can scan Human QR feed codes from their phones. 
   * Value: [HIGH] Brain currency is an essential part of the game, and the alternative to keeping track 
		   of it on the app is using a complex honor system.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] We must implement a QR code scanner, interface with a camera, and communicate it with the server.
   * Priority: [MH] This is crucial to gameplay, and is too complicated to be managed by the mods outside of the app.
7. Feed codes can be printed for those who don’t have the app.
   * Value: [HIGH] Those without smartphones need to have feed codes, and some people might want a backup.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] We would simply need to have a way for players to print their QR code or number, without the app. 
   * Priority: [MH] This is important to include non-app-using players.
8. Zombies can purchase upgrades using brains.
   * Value: [HIGH] Zombies collect brains to purchase upgrades, so this is essential functionality for the game.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Implement a system to reduce brain currency and update status (if they are permanent upgrades).
   * Priority: [MH] This needs to be in place in order to run the game, and would not be too hard to 
                    implement once the brain transfer system is in place.
9. There should be a system in place to transfer the brains (zombie currency) between other zombies.
   * Value: [HIGH] Brain currency is an integral part of the game and would be almost impossible to track outside of the app.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Changing the value of two players’ statuses.  
   * Priority: [MH] This basic functionality needs to be in place for the game and is easy to implement.
10. There is a list of players, displaying names and status as a human or zombie, accessible from the home screen.
   * Value: [HIGH] Players like to see the numbers dwindle, and it is currently a main feature of the website that many players look at.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] This would involve getting data from the server and displaying it in a clear way.
   * Priority: [MH] This is an essential part of gameplay to know who is which role.
11. [USERS] The number of humans remaining is displayed on the home screen.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] An engaging and interesting feature for the home page.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Take data from the server 
   * Priority: [MH] It would be nice to summarize the player data, and this should not be too hard to implement after we get the player data.
12. The visual interface is clear and organized, with tabs for each category of information 
    (night, day, legendary, story, logistics; the stuff that goes in emails)
   * Value: [HIGH] Many players would like to see information about the game in a more clear manner than currently implemented.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] We must optimize the UI to be elegant and usable. We would have to fully understand the user psychology. 
			It will probably take a few tries. It could be done simply easily, but done well would take a lot more work.
   * Priority: [MH] Without this, the app could be unusable regardless of functionality.
13. Players can easily find and view important information about the game (rules, logistics, mission information)
   * Value: [HIGH] Users mentioned that this would be easier to navigate than the email. 
		   It would be a nice way to find information in an uncluttered way.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Just need to display text and links, but we would have to make sure it is displayed in an easy manner.
   * Priority: [MH] This feature would be useful for players, but information could be sent out in emails as it has been in the past
14. Mods can update night mission, day mission, and legendary quest information.
   * Value: [HIGH] Moderators need to do this in order to manage the game. 
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Need an interface for the moderators, connection to a server, and ability to push these updates to the local apps of players. 
   * Priority: [MH] Mods should manage the game
15. The Mods will have access to adjust players status. They should be able to update legendary status for zombies, 
    resurrect human players, and update zombie upgrades.
   * Value: [HIGH] Mods need to be able to manage players during the game, especially if something goes wrong or needs to be changed manually. 
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Provide an interface to change information in the database. 
   * Priority: [MH] These tools will have and have previously been needed inM gameplay 
16. There will be a detailed map of the 7Cs in the app.
   * Value: [HIGH] Easy to locate specific places that are mentioned in the missions, and other important info like safe zones. 
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Just needs to display an image of a map, with zooming and panning.
   * Priority: [MH] Gives players (especially new students) a layout of where events will occur.
________________


Cut-off for release 1.0: Everything above this cut-off line is critical to game play and an important feature that was requested by users. 
These are features that are too valuable not to include, which is why these will be the requirements for the first release.




17. Keep track of player statistics (zombie tags, human stuns, mission activity).
   * Value: [HIGH] From a mod point of view, this is a good way to organize information about players.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Easily to create graphs and counters
   * Priority: [MH] This is important for gameplay and info that mods wish to have on hand
18. [USERS] The default setting will be to not share your location, to protect the user’s privacy.
   * Value: [HIGH] We must respect players’ privacy.  
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] It is just turning location on or off.
   * Priority: [MH] This is not difficult and critical to respecting their privacy.
19. There is a tab that contains the story so far.
   * Value: [HIGH] Help create an organized and coherent story; players don’t have to rummage through a bunch of emails to understand it. 
			It should be more appreciated, and easily accessible. 
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Include another tab with this organized info
   * Priority: [SH] Lots of value to the players that they currently don’t have a convenient way to access. Not very difficult to implement.
20. [USERS] Players can easily access current mission information from the home screen, such as a summary of the mission (story and tasks),
	    a map of the mission path, and the number of zombies and humans at the mission.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] This was mentioned as a cool feature by users, but the game has functioned in the past without it. 
		     Would add a lot of value in accessing things for missions.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Click (countdown?) to page with mission info, must be regularly updated. Might be variable based on mission type.
   * Priority: [SH] Players expressed that this would be valuable for missions, although it isn’t the easiest thing to implement.
21. If the players choose to allow locations services, which will be marked clearly when on, 
    their current location will be marked on the map to allow them to navigate easily to a specific location.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] Help new players not get lost, but they could still use Google Maps, etc.  
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Making our own accurate location system/interfacing with an existing map application could be difficult,
		          but tools probably exist to get location.
   * Priority: [SH] This is dynamic, which is more difficult and less critical.
22. Mods should also be able to send out notifications, reminders, and information on the missions. 
   * Value: [HIGH] This will assist gameplay and organize the players
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Send out quick notifications to all players 
   * Priority: [MH] Mods must be able to contact their players in a easy way
23. The app should provide helpful notifications to players. (The notifications will provide updates, announcements, 
    and reminders for missions, as well as helpful information, and reminders from Mods.)
   * Value: [HIGH] Players should receive up-to-date info from the mods. 
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Interface with phone system and should be quick. 
   * Priority: [SH] Would accelerate communication between mods and players.
24. The notifications should be customizable to avoid spamming players. 
    (Including mission-specific notifications and notifications for when humans turn to zombies.)
   * Value: [HIGH] Some players do not want to be spammed with notifications.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Each notification will have to be able to be grouped by a definable category.  
   * Priority: [SH] The players would be overwhelmed with notifications otherwise. 
		    The mods can choose to send out only crucial notifications if customization is not implemented.
25. Players can report that they are attending a mission (perhaps through a QR code scanning).
   * Value: [MEDIUM] This is a useful feature for the mods, and it can be integrated with players receiving mission-specific notifications
		     and a special home screen.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Just need to track this on the player profiles.
   * Priority: [SH] The value for the mods and the low cost makes it worthwhile.
26. The map will show important general information like marked safe zones, missions, and quest locations. 
   * Value: [HIGH] Players would greatly benefit from being able to view important information related to their tasks on a map.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Will need to dynamically overlay key places on the map based on changing data from the server. 
		        Must update to all players quickly and accurately.
   * Priority: [SH] This will assist gameplay
27. Mods can adjust important locations on the map, such as the spawn location, and players can view these locations.
   * Value: [HIGH] Creates less confusion gameplay
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] We must give mods executive authority to change map and update information to all players. 
   * Priority: [SH] This would assist gameplay, but is very difficult to implement on a first release.
28. [USERS] Players can access descriptions of active legendary upgrades, with the owner of the upgrade displayed.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] It is important to understand what the upgrades are.  
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] It is just a page with text on it.
   * Priority: [SH] Easy to implement and the players need to have a way to view legendary upgrades.
29. Have a list of legendary upgrade holders.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] It is important to know who is a legendary, but the legendary status could also be included in the main player list.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] It is an easy title or list to make.
   * Priority: [SH] A separate list of legendaries would be useful, but this information could be shown in the player list.
30. The human and zombie players should view a slightly different UI upon login, such that a human cannot report a zombie feedcode, etc.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] There are some things specific to players that it would be nice for other players not to see
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] If we can easily access the account’s status, it could be a simple switch.
   * Priority: [SH] This would make the game run more smoothly and is not too difficult to implement.
31. [USERS] Automated emails for players without the app.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] Particularly if the notifications are moved to the app, players without the app need a way to view notifications. 
		     And an automatic method for doing this would be useful to the mods.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] It could be difficult to implement an automatic email sender. 
   * Priority: [SH] This is an important feature, but they could write the updates themself.
32. This email list should be able to opt into for all players (It will include general updates that would have been provided via the
    notifications on the app.)
   * Value: [HIGH] Allows for users to not use the app to still play the game.  
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] We just need to record who gets the email, and save their address. 
   * Priority: [SH] This would be easy, and would likely happen either way.
33. Mods can save data from the current game.
   * Value: [LOW] This is probably a useful feature for moderators, but we unfortunately have not been able to interview moderator users yet.
   * Confidence: [LOW]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Interfacing with the database and saving lots of organized information  
   * Priority: [NH] We do not know when is a situation where a mod would want to look at previous game’s info
34. [USERS] If in a hurry, the human who was turned should be able to “self report” that they were turned into a zombie
            instead of inputting a feedcode, i.e. during the final mission.
   * Value: [LOW] This would be a helpful feature in a rush for players and for a nice feature during the final mission.  
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] There is a risk if there is a discrepancy when communicating with the server if zombie status is double reported.
   * Priority: [NH] This is useful for keeping track of numbers, but not super valuable and possibly difficult to implement.
35. [USERS] Current zombie stun timer length is displayed on home screen for all players.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] This is an important piece of information, especially if we are reducing the number of emails.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] It would be pretty easy to display and update this information. 
		       There could be a difficulty if the stun timer differs by area.
   * Priority: [NH] This would be convenient, but this information could be placed in other locations in or outside of the app.
36. [USERS] During important and final missions, there should be a clear and active display of the number of human and zombie players.
   * Value: [LOW] Nice to have, but players can see it with their eyes.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] A simple counter, but must stay up-to-date quickly
   * Priority: [NH] Not necessary for game play and does not add substantial value
37. [USERS] There should be a clear banner with the countdown to the start of the next mission on the home screen.
   * Value: [LOW] Players can keep track of it in other ways, but they did think it was a cool idea.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] A timer to a specific time. Could click to reach current mission.  
   * Priority: [NH] Since the mission time is announced elsewhere, players could keep track of this themselves.
38. Human players can report that they stunned a zombie at any time, which will be recorded in their human player stats and status.
   * Value: [LOW] This is not a feature that has been used before, but could be a new cool feature for human players.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] This would be a simple counter as part of player status.
   * Priority: [NH] Not very useful, even if it is easy to implement.
39. Players have their own profile page to view their statistics and status.
   * Value: [LOW] It would be nice to view your own statistics, or change your personal info. 
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Allowing players to view their own profiles/player point of view won’t be too much work.
   * Priority: [NH] Allowing a player to view their owns stats is not necessary
40. [USERS] View location of active moderators, in case of emergency.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] Good for emergencies, but has not been needed in the past.  
   * Confidence: [LOW]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Accurately update the location of a specific player and shown to all other players 
   * Priority: [NH] This is not something that was needed previously. 
41. If they wish, players can pin locations of zombies or humans to report if they see any large groups of other players. 
   * Value: [LOW] Players liked this feature, but they said that other features of the map should require more importance.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Dynamically include pins in map that all players must see regularly. 
   * Priority: [NH] Can be done with a substitute messaging app. Required to be dynamic so is a high difficulty feature with low
                    enhancement to the gameplay.
42. [USERS] When stunned, the zombie can start a timer in the app, with the up-to-date stun time, which is marked clearly for them to see.
   * Value: [LOW] Helpful, but most smartphones have a simple timer app already.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] Start a timer.
   * Priority: [NH] Adds some fun to the game, but it can easily be done without.
43. Zombies can send out a custom message when they scan a feed code (maybe to the all-player chat)
   * Value: [LOW] It is a nice feature of the website, but definitely not necessary or highly valued by the players.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] We must implement a simple request for a string to send out.
   * Priority: [NH] Could contribute to jokes between humans and zombies but not necessary and can be easily 
                    substituted w/ outside messaging apps.
44. [USERS] Day missions and quests are broken up into specific tasks, and players can pin or claim a particular task.
   * Value: [LOW] Helpful to organize mission tasks, but humans could also do this on their own without it being a specific feature.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] A part of the aforementioned mission page, but must be shared in an organized way with the other players
   * Priority: [NH] This would be useful, but can be done by players on their own and could be difficult to implement.
45. The players will have the option to share location information privately, will a small selected group, or publicly to all players. 
   * Value: [LOW] Helpful, but not necessary 
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Accurately share current location, as well as privately send it to a group of people, 
                        which should be displayed on the map. 
   * Priority: [NH] This dynamic feature will be difficult to implement and not add significant value.  
46. There will be another chat to communicate directly to the Mods. This chat will feature an anonymous option, 
    so the players can report anonymous questions or concerns. 
   * Value: [LOW] This would be a useful feature, but it can be done through a messenger/discord chat or email.
   * Confidence: [LOW]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] We would have to implement some sort of communication functionality, although it 
                          could be simpler than the larger group chats.
   * Priority: [NH] It is valuable to be able to contact a moderator in the case of an emergency, but it can be done other ways.
47. View who tagged which zombies through an ancestry tree.
   * Value: [LOW] Users had not heard of this and it is not vital to the game, but they thought it would be a cool feature.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] A variant of a tree or linked list possibly, but could be complicated with resurrections,
                          and presenting in an elegant way.   
   * Priority: [NH] While this is cool, it is not part of gameplay
48. [USERS] There will be three large chats: one for the zombies, one for humans, and one for all players.
   * Value: [LOW] Messenger/Discord already exists, but an automatically created group chat could be helpful.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM] 
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] Something might exist to manage this, but if not this would be difficult to implement. 
			It would take a lot of work at the very least.
   * Priority: [NH] It is nice to have a convenient chatting feature, but these things already exist and might not be 
 		    worth the effort to create one ourselves.
49. [USERS] The chat should also support picture and video files. 
   * Value: [LOW] Just like the basic chat feature, this can be done over other communication channels.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] If we had to create a chat feature, it would have to support more than strings. 
   * Priority: [NH] Has low value and high difficulty. Too much focus on this feature would dedicate too much time 
		    to chat capabilities when this app is not primarily for chatting.
50. [USERS] Players get booted from human chat when they get turned into zombies.
   * Value: [LOW] People can leave chat on their own.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] If we have a chat, it should be easy to remove a player.  
   * Priority: [NH] Players could leave the chat on their own, and chat itself could be done through other means.
51. Humans have the option to send one last message to the human chat.
   * Value: [LOW] Humans can send their message to the all-player chat if this is not implemented.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [LOW] If we have a chat, this could be a simple prompt.  
   * Priority: [NH] This is a nice feature, but is not necessary.
52. View other statistics such as meals per hour and dorm representation.
   * Value: [LOW] None of the users we interviewed cared about this.
   * Confidence: [HIGH]
   * Difficulty: [MEDIUM] Annoying to implement, keeping track of lots of data and making clear visualizations for them.
   * Priority: [NH] This was not highly asked for by the users
53. [USERS] Website component to mirror the app online.
   * Value: [MEDIUM] Provides a way for users without smartphones to access the app information.
   * Confidence: [MEDIUM]
   * Difficulty: [HIGH] We would have to create a functioning website on top of the app. 
   * Priority: [NH] A substantial amount of work would be added to the project
