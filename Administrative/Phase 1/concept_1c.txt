* Introduce everyone
* Establish Context/Problem
   * Review of website (and game?)
      * Main uses
      * Only facts, no adjectives 
      * “Provides basic functionality of the game”
         * Registering players, feedcodes, population lists (who’s human and zombie)
   * Website could become unusable soon with updates to Django in 2021
* Possible product
   * NO FEATURES
   * Basic website functionality
   * Could include other features to help the game run more smoothly
   * Incorporate assets of a mobile device
      * Notifications
      * Camera
      * Location services
* Open ended ideas
   * What would you like to see on an HvZ app?
      * If needed as prompts:
         * To help with missions?
         * Game play?
         * Brains? Stuns?
         * Population stats?
         * Story?
   * What features do you like or dislike in the website?
   * What do you like or dislike about the current website in general?
   * Does anything concern you about a new app?
   * For moderators, what sort of mod-specific things/administrative would you like in the app?
* More specific questions (if not mentioned earlier)
   * What do you think about a map feature?
      * Could let you know about safe zones too
   * What do you think about the ancestry tree?
   * What do you think about it having messaging capabilities?
   * What do you think about receiving information about missions and mission updates in the app (like how the email list works)?
   * What do you think about receiving app notifications?
   * What do you think about having a tab in the app which contains the story segments up to that point?
   * What do you think about having a feature where you can register as squads and view squads similarly to how you view humans and zombies?
   * If you don’t want a chat room, would you want some way to contact mods through the app? Incognito?
   * Would you like a statistics tab to view different stats? (outbreak over time, players by campus and dorm, meals per hour)
