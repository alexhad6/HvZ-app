Requirements Elicitation Report

The meeting took place on Thursday, September 10, 2020 from 1:10 PM to 1:50 PM
PDT in Prof. Mark Kampe’s Zoom meeting for CS 121. It was attended by Ingrid
Tsang (itsang@g.hmc.edu), Ilona Kariko (ikariko@g.hmc.edu), and Solomon
Valore-Caplan (svalorecaplan@g.hmc.edu), all Harvey Mudd students and HvZ
players. The meeting was run by Santiago Rodriguez, Kyra Clark, Matthew Waddell,
and Alex Hadley, and was also viewed by Prof. Mark Kampe and the other students
in the Fall 2020 section of CSCI121 HM-01.
        
During the open-ended information gathering session, the following features and
functionalities were suggested for the app. New requirements are labelled as
[NEW]. Additional information is included as a sub bullet point.
* List of current humans and zombies
   * Important, should be accessible from home screen
* Display and scan feed code
   * Users dislike having to remember to carry paper feed code
* Access important announcements
   * Users find it hard to go through email to find information
* View and search Claremont Colleges locations on a map
   * Especially useful for new students
* View your current location on the map
   * Convenient
* View mission and quest related locations on the map
   * It is hard to keep track of all the key locations, especially for the final
     mission
* Story tab that consolidates the story so far
   * Users frequently miss parts of the story and are confused
* [NEW] List of legendary players
   * Important to know who has legendary upgrades
* [NEW] Descriptions of active legendary roles
   * Important to know what abilities each legendary has, especially for new
     players


These users were not very familiar with the current website (claremonthvz.org)
or its features. They had not heard of the ancestry tree, but thought it was a
cool idea to have a record of who tagged who. They thought that having a
statistics tab could be fun, although the most important statistic is who is
currently human or zombie.
* Zombie ancestry tree
   * Since users were not familiar, this feature is low priority
* Additional statistics tab
   * Lower priority than we thought


The users raised the issue of accessibility, pointing out that some players
might not have access to a smartphone. They suggested having an optional email
list to complement the app for sending out important announcements. Solomon said
he would sign up for the email list and the app, while Ingrid would prefer only
app notifications. After the session, Spencer Lang, a CS 121 student, suggested
using Flutter to have a website as well as an app.
* Optional email list
   * Announcements are accessible for players without smartphones
* [NEW] Automatically send emails of certain app announcements
   * Make it easier for moderators to manage the game
   * [SIGNIFICANT] The people without the app need to be able to play
* [NEW] Website component
   * Allows access to app content without a smartphone


When asked, users gave more feedback on the map feature. Ingrid raised the point
of privacy, and having location sharing turned off by default. The following
features were suggested:
* [NEW] Location turned off by default
   * Important due to privacy concerns
   * [SIGNIFICANT] Uncomfortable using app if location not turned off by default
* [NEW] Ability to send location at a particular instant
   * Useful for people who do not want to share their location live
   * Important due to privacy concerns
* Mod location sharing for spawn
   * Useful during missions
* Share location with specific people
   * Useful for quests or missions
* Mark locations of zombies or humans on map
   * Users suggested ability to mark general locations (e.g. “Zombies near
     Kingston”)


We also asked users about a messaging feature within the app. The following
features were suggested:
* Big group chats for humans and zombies
   * Ability to add or invite people who get tagged
* [NEW] Automatically booted from human chat when you are turned
   * Ensures that zombies cannot access human information
* [NEW] Send images and other files over the chat
   * Important to send photos during puzzle quests or missions

The following features were suggested relating to missions:
* [NEW] Show key information (like maps or story) on home page during mission
   * Easy to access during the mission
   * [SIGNIFICANT] For easy gameplay and usable app interface
* [NEW] Missions listed as particular tasks
   * Less important, but makes it easier to coordinate
* [NEW] Ability to pin certain mission tasks
   * Less important, allows players to organize responsibilities

   * Players will know when missions are happening
* [NEW] Countdown banner for mission on home screen
   * Allows players to see when mission is going to start
* Ability to contact mods via chat
   * It is hard or takes longer to contact mods via email

The users thought that around 2 to 3 notifications per day was reasonable to
send to all players, but that receiving other notifications should be
customizable.
* [NEW] Ability to subscribe to notifications for a particular mission
   * Allows coordination during the mission, but only for those who are
     attending
* [NEW] Subscribe to get notified whenever a human is tagged
   * Lower priority, but could be useful for very active players

The users brought up the issue that during the final mission, feed codes are not
typically scanned. However, it is important during this mission to know how many
humans are left.
* [NEW] Track number of humans left during final mission
   * Important since the mission ends when there are no humans left
   * [SIGNIFICANT] For better gameplay experience during final mission
* [NEW] Humans can self-report that they were tagged during final mission
   * In the chaos of the mission, it is hard to register feed codes. During the
     final mission, who is a zombie is more important than who tagged who.
   * [SIGNIFICANT] To keep the populations active and easy to report for players

A few more features were also suggested relating to registering zombie tags and
human stuns.
* Announcements page of zombie tags
   * Allows players to know who is tagged
* Track stuns per human
   * Users suggested that maybe zombies could input stuns since humans might run
   away
* [NEW] Zombie stun timer
   * Important for zombies to know when they are no longer stunned. Could be
     integrated with registering stuns
* [NEW] Display current stun time on home screen
   * Important for all players to know, since this changes throughout the game
   * [SIGNIFICANT] For clarity during gameplay

The users said that they would probably not use video or audio chatting through
the app. They were also against the idea of players registering as squads,
saying groups tend to form in the moment when playing the game. They also
mentioned that a messaging feature in the app could be nice, but was low
priority, since current solutions like Facebook Messenger work fine.

At the end of the session, the users identified the following features as high
priority:
* Display and scan feed codes
* List of current humans and zombies
* Important announcement information
* Map of Claremont Colleges locations and mission locations
* View your own location on map

The users identified the following features as very useful, but of lower
priority:
* Announcement notifications
* Ability to mark locations on the map
* Location sharing
