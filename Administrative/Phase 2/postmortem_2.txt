                               Phase 2 Postmortem

In this phase of the project, we created a preliminary architecture proposal for
our project, and had it reviewed by multiple sources in order to create a final
and fully comprehensive architecture proposal and plan.

Below is a list of the things we learned, what worked well and what has room for
growth in our process.

Creation of the Initial Architecture
• This is the very first initial brainstorming of what our architecture is.
• We did this via a google jamboard, which allowed for better collaboration.
• From our architecture, we came up with initial questions to ask.
• In retrospect, it is possible that this is the meeting we should’ve had
  earlier, in order to give us more time for the large amount of work that this
  part of the project would entail. 
• However, for the most part, this meeting served its purpose well, which was to
  get us started on thinking about our architecture to prepare for a future
  meeting with the professor.

Initial Refinement of the Architecture
• The refinement involved making decisions based on initial brainstorming and
  professor’s notes. 
• We organized the questions we wanted to ask the professor, then scheduled a
  brief meeting to pitch our ideas and receive initial feedback.
• Because we were prepared when we reached out to the professor, we were able to
  get the most out of that short meeting. 
• This meeting was helpful because the professor gave us insight on the next
  steps to take to develop our architecture. 
• From here, we revised our previous ideas and sketches and were able to divide
  up work for future development. 
• Looking back on this part of the project, we learned that we need to improve
  the dates and organization of our documents. While we did get better at taking
  notes on every meeting, some of these notes were difficult to find. 


Component Design Analyses
• We constructed a list of components, then met with the professor to get
  further clarification on what to expect in an architecture proposal. We
  learned that this involved much more than we were expecting, including
  Stories, Connections, and a Diagram.  
• Even though we did not know until this point exactly what our expectations
  were, we did what we could to prepare ourselves for each meeting. This set us
  up well when we did understand what to do. 
• Once we knew what to do, we were able to put it together from all of our
  initial brainstorming and documents. 
• From here, we outlined questions for each component, and then divided up
  research for everyone to work on separately and write up in the draft. 

Creating Draft Architectural Description
• This took a lot of time and work.
• We worked very hard to write thorough and well-thought out architecture, but
  because of the quantity of work, we were forced to use a slip day to make sure
  everything was turned in on time.
• Not only was it a lot of work, but we also wanted to be sure that everyone
  understood each component well and everyone had a chance to fully review the
  draft. 
• In retrospect, we are happy with the quality of the work that we did turn in.
  Because of the amount of time and effort we put in at the beginning, future
  phases of the project were less work. 

Studying for Your Design Review
• To prepare for the design review, we did most of this work completely
  individually. There was a lot of stress in the beginning because we nearly did
  not receive their architecture in time for the meeting on Friday. 
• We each read and reviewed the architecture on our own. 
• We met before the review to divide up the roles of the meeting and set
  expectations for what each of us should be thinking about during the meeting.  
• We were careful not to share any thoughts about their architecture before the
  meeting, in order not to create biased opinions before the meeting. 

The Design Review Meeting (as a Reviewer)
• We did not record each issue as a must-fix, should-fix, or comment during the
  meeting. This was in part because we did not see an example in class.
• We could have more thoroughly read each requirement of the meeting. This meant
  that we did not know that we were supposed to put a date, and attendees at the
  beginning of the notes. 
• We did not summarize the meeting at the end. We should keep this in mind for
  future reviews.

The Design Review Meeting (as a Reviewee)
• We tried to answer their questions without spending too much time justifying
  our original approach. Particularly when the comment was a criticism, we tried
  to simply take what they said into account rather than defending our decisions.
  This was a little tricky in the beginning, but we did a pretty good job.
• We took some notes in the form of Google Doc comments on our architecture
  during the meeting, just to help process what they were saying. This could
  have also been a helpful resource if we want to look back on exactly what was
  said at the meeting in addition to the meeting report. 

Writing up the Review Report and Working the Issues
• We divided up the work of the meeting using the scribe’s notes from the review
  meeting. 
• This part of the project went very smoothly. 
• We were all very engaged with the review meeting, which allowed for everyone
  to have the ideas fresh in their minds. This means that we came to a consensus
  easily and wrote up our work effectively. 

Revising your Architecture to Address the Issues
• Because we did so well in our initial architecture, there was very little
  pointed out to us that we needed to change.
• This allowed us to focus our time less on issues and more on optimizing our
  architecture through more in-depth research that we did not have time to do
  during the preliminary draft. So, even though we did not need to, we still
  created fundamental change in our architecture that greatly improved its
  performance. 
• Because this week of work aligned with midterms season, it was very difficult
  for everyone to find the time to work on this project. However, through
  collaboration, we created shared expectations for how much work we should try
  to get done before each meeting. Despite the stressful time, we were still
  able to productively improve our architecture from the revisions. 

The Planning and Ongoing Management of these Activities
• After looking at the preliminary architecture assignment, we found that we had
  questions about what we were supposed to do.
    • Add a task to the management plan that we need to read the assignment by a
      certain date for the next week.
    • If we have questions, we can ask them much earlier. This will allow a more
      productive Monday meeting.
• We should update our management plan more regularly throughout the phase. We
  tried to update it more this time, but we often scheduled meetings or assigned
  tasks without immediately updating the plan.
• Although we improved on our notetaking from the previous phase, we can still
  improve on the amount of notes we take and dating them to find later. 
• We made new plans as we went along, according to if we need more time to
  complete a project or if we have specific questions to ask before moving on. 

The Overall Project as an Educational Exercise
• We did better in this phase (as opposed to phase 1) of splitting up and
  parallelizing work where possible.
    • We also figured out a method where someone would finish up doing a final
      task on a document, then text the group, and the other members would have
      an hour or two to review the changes before the primary author submitted.
    • This eliminated the need for another review meeting.
• We should improve dating and organization of the files in our shared Drive.
    • We tried to improve this by labelling the documents by section, although
      when looking back during the post mortem meeting, we found that a few
      documents were hard to find.
