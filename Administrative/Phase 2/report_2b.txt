Review Report for Team TBD


PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
* We were unsure of what it meant that the idea was not feasible. It was 
described as the direct pay from the app not being feasible, but the card 
selection algorithm would be feasible. We decided it should be made more clear 
what they mean in this section.
   * [QUESTION], [COMMENT]


COMPONENTS
* In general, you should also go into more detail about how the app and its 
core features will be implemented using AWS and React Native. For example, maybe 
link to web pages that discuss how to make a basic app using React Native, or 
how to implement authentication using AWS. This is crucial to evaluating the 
feasibility of the project.
   * [ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]
* Authentication should be discussed in greater detail. An authentication page 
is mentioned within the app component, but there are no details about how 
authentication itself will be implemented. Identity verification is especially 
important for this app since personal financial information can be accessed.
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* You should go into more detail regarding the implementation of the card 
optimization algorithm. It makes sense that the exact algorithm is not known 
yet, but in our review meeting we got a more detailed explanation of the utility 
function. This more detailed explanation should be included in the architecture. 
This is an important issue since the algorithm is the app’s core feature, and it 
must be possible to evaluate its feasibility.
   * [ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]
* It is mentioned that the card optimization algorithm “will be located in a 
headless cloud function in AWS.” However, there is no explanation of what a cloud 
function is or how it will be implemented. AWS Lambda and its features should be 
discussed explicitly.
   * [ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]
* It is stated that the card optimization algorithm will be implemented as a single 
function. However, it sounds like a complex feature. You should discuss why it can 
be implemented as a single function, or if it will require multiple functions or a 
more complicated programming structure, such as a class.
   * [QUESTION / ISSUE], [COMMENT]
* It is mentioned that the card optimization algorithm is “definitely doable” without 
justification. You should clarify and explicitly list your justification. 
   * [QUESTION / ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]   
* Card benefits component is stored in the AWS database, but this is not clear from 
your description. The method of input is also not made explicit. Is the input going 
to be manual, done with web scraping or some other undefined method? This issue is 
important because optimization algorithms depend on this data being valid.
   * [QUESTION / ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]   
* User Storage depends on what type of information can be extracted from Plaid, which 
is currently unspecified and unknown. From the document, there is not clear 
information on Plaid, and its interactions with the rest of the architecture are not 
clear. 
   * [QUESTION / ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]   
* NoSQL Database did not have its type specified. Specifying the type of database 
needed would give insight into your app interactions needs and how the type of data 
you are storing relates to each other. The AWS selection is without specific 
justification giving the impression such selection may be without research. However, 
since functionality likely does not hinge on type of database this issue is not so 
severe.
   * [QUESTION / ISSUE], [COMMENT]   


INTERFACES
* In general, you are only providing information on how information travels through 
your component in one direction. You should discuss how all the information is passed 
back and forth between any given component. Furthermore, you should be more clear on 
the arrows to be more descriptive if it is a one-way or two-way connection. 
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* Some connections between components are missing. It is crucial that you understand 
and describe how every component is connected. For example, you could be more clear 
on how and where the Card Optimization Algorithm is connected with the other 
components, or what connects to the Cloud and how.
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* You mention “CRUD” operations, however, you do not discuss what they are. You 
should be more specific into how you are using it for each component.   
   * [QUESTION], [SHOULD-FIX]


TESTS
* There was a sign-in service mentioned in the testing section, yet it was not included 
as part of the architecture. This needs to be included either as a component or as part 
of a component (needs mentioning as part of the architecture somewhere). It was 
demonstrated that it would not be too difficult to implement a sign-in service with the 
technology you plan on using, but it is important to keep it in the architecture rather 
than in your head.
   * [ISSUE], [SHOULD-FIX]
* Security was mentioned for the application in a discussion about testing for security. 
The team expects AWS and Plaid to handle security issues, but it is not listed in the 
architecture as a component or as part of a component. This needs to be explicit so 
that they correctly plan around implementing it later on.
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]


DIAGRAM
* The arrows and connections between components should be more clear. Consider which 
connections are one-way and which are two-way. These connections should be described 
and made clear. 
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* It appears that some components, that were listed in the Components or Interface 
sections were missing in this diagram. Perhaps this was just confusion caused by the 
aforementioned naming problem, or you should review your diagram and confirm that every 
connection and component is included. For example, the Personal Preference Survey is missing. 
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* It could be useful to include and clarify which components are internal with the other 
components. Also, you could mention which are an external tool that you will be 
implementing into your app. This could make the organization and grouping of the 
components in the diagram more clear and intuitive. 
   * [ISSUE / QUESTION], [SHOULD-FIX]


PROTOTYPE
* This is an impressive prototype, however, you must include more detail on how you made 
this prototype. Describe how you make it in React, why you made it, and what this early 
prototype can do. You should also describe what you learned about your architecture from 
making this prototype. Did it affect your decisions about components or architecture 
in any way?  
   * [ISSUE / QUESTION], [SHOULD-FIX]


OVERALL THOUGHTS
* We wondered why Plaid would be needed in the architecture if the direct payment from 
the app were not possible. It turns out that Plaid would provide card information crucial 
to the card selection algorithm. We felt this was unclear in the architectural description, 
and we decided there should be a component description of it.
   * [QUESTION], [MUST-FIX]
* We felt that there was not enough description of how the components interacted with 
each other. There should be user stories to outline this process for the functions of the 
app, and the descriptions of connections should be more detailed. This is important for 
making the architecture explicit in how it is able to meet your requirements for the project.
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]
* There is very little naming consistency throughout your architecture. This creates a very 
confusing experience for your readers. You should standardize the names you use, in order 
to make your overall process and diagram more clear. This will allow readers to look back 
and find any information throughout your architecture easier. 
   * [ISSUE], [MUST-FIX]


DISPOSITION
* Approved with Required Changes
* Through our meeting, we felt like you knew what you were doing and talking about, but 
what you wrote did not reflect that. In general, your report seemed rushed. There were many 
important pieces that were missing that it would be very difficult to fully approve this 
project if we only had the report to understand your architecture. From the meeting, we got 
a much better sense that you understood your architecture and design, but this must be made 
clear in the document to be approved. Fundamental reorganization of architecture is not 
required, but major changes are as important sections of the document were missing.
* From the perspective of a peer reviewer on this project, we believe that your team knows 
what they are doing, but they struggled to capture their ideas fully and clearly. But, with 
enough time, they will definitely be able to adjust their architecture to be completely 
acceptable, which includes adding the missing sections and making their report overall more clear.
