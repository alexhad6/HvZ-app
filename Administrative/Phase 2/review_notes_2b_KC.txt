    Architecture Review Notes

* Overall
    - There is a BIG problem of naming consistency. Sometimes things are called databases, 
      sometimes not. You really need to stick with one name for a component to help the 
      reader know what is going on. Or you need to get a better understand of what each
      individual part acutally is. 
    - You could use some better organization. 
    - In general, everything felt very vague. I would go into more detail explaining each
      component and how it connects to everything else. 

* App
    - built with Reach Native & AWS Amplify suite
    - I noticed you wrote a little bit about this in terms of feasibility, but I think
      you should really go into more detail about what it is, exactly how you plan on using
      it, and how it connects to the rest of the component. 
    - Authenticiation Page:
        ~ You should really go into more detail. Authentication can be really complicated and 
          you should develop a plan. Will you use external authentication? How? Where is it
          stored? How do you know it is secure? Include some of these details here. 

* Card Optimization
    - "We do not know how we will go about making the function yet"
        ~ You proably should at least have a small plan for this now
        ~ You say this will be locatede in AWS. Again, what is this? how does it connect? 
    - "Our plan for an initial algorithm is to use a utility function which will run each 
      card thourh a uility function based on user's preferences."
        ~ This planning is circular. Do you see the potential problem?
        ~ What preferences? How do you plan on getting them and implementing the algorithm?
        ~ You said it yourself, this is the meat of your product. So, this description 
          shouldn't be vague. Go into more detail on how you will go about perfecting it, 
          especially since you outlined that as a potential challenge. 

* User Storage
    - Explain "API, like Plaid". What are these things? How do they work? How do they 
      connect? How do you know it is secure?
    - How to the Plaid database and Plaid connect with each other and to the app? 

* Card Benefits Info
    - "this is where we store..." Where?
    - This is a crucial part of your architecture, yet I have no idea what it acutally is. 
        ~ What is it? Software? Code? UI? Algorithm? etc. 
        ~ How do you get the info from the users or for the updated rewards automatically?

* Payment Linking
    - much more detail is needed here. It is written very confusing. You need to clarify 
      what is going on here. 
    - "if we find an API" -> Now is the time to find one. 

* Personal Preference Survey
    - You mention a UI profile but you haven't explained what that is yet. 
    - Is this on the app or the cloud? 
    - the "cloud" you mention is also only very loosely defined. 

* Interfaces
    - This title is super unclear. Consider breaking this section up and calling this part
      "Connections" or something and the other "Testing"
    - You mention "CRUD Operations," you you haven't described what that is at all yet. 
    - No card optimizaiton connection or cloud connection explained. 
    - Your diagram and/or connections sections is missing connections. You should describe
      every component connection. 

* Design Prototype
    - This is only a picture. I have so many questions. How? Who? What? What did you learn? 
      Feasible? 
    - You've GOT to explain this more. You cannot just include a picture and expect me to 
      know what you did, its purpose, and what is going on.
