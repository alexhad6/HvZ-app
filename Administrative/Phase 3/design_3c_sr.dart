/// Project 3C.1 â€” Component Design: File Storage
///   Design: https://github.com/alexhad6/HvZ-app/blob/master/Administrative/Phase%203/design_3c_sr.dart
///   Primary author: Santiago
///
/// This is a design document for the File Storage component of the HvZ App.
/// The File Storage component is responsible for uploading and downloading
/// mission files to and from the Firebase cloud storage (https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).
/// It also ensures that cached values are used when available rather than
/// downloading from file storage each time. The documentation for Flutter's
/// Firebase storage integration is here https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/storage/usage.
///
/// This component implements a single class called FileStorageService which is
/// called whenever any component needs to upload or download from the file storage.

import 'package:flutter_cache_manager_firebase/flutter_cache_manager_firebase.dart';

// importing the firebase cloud storage package

// importing asynchronous function activity to wait for firebase to respond
import 'dart:async';

/// Purpose: contains functions for uploading and downloading files to the file
/// storage. Makes use of cached values when returning a file stream.
