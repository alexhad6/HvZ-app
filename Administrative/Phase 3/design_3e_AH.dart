/// Project 3E â€” Final Component Design: Authentication
///   Design: https://github.com/alexhad6/HvZ-app/blob/master/Administrative/Phase%203/design_3e_AH.dart
///   Primary author: Alex
///
/// This is a design document for the authentication and registration component
/// for the HvZ app. Currently the following is just an outline of the instance
/// variables and the public and private methods for this component. The
/// implementation is outlined using pseudo-code.
///
/// The main singleton class [Auth] that implements the functionality of the
/// authentication component. [AuthMessage] is a smaller, helper class to return
/// the success status and error messages from sign in and registration
/// operations (`registerWithEmail()`, `signInWithEmail()`,
/// `signInWithGoogle()`, and `resetPassword()`).
///
/// In order to use the [Auth] class, one first needs to call the Auth()
/// constructor. Since this is a singleton class, the constructor will always
/// return a reference to the same class. Next, calling `initiliaze()`
/// makes it so that [Auth] starts tracking who is currently signed in using a
/// listener (see `initialize()`). After this setup, the external interfaces can
/// be called; see the specifications (https://github.com/alexhad6/HvZ-app/blob/master/Administrative/Phase%203/spec_3e_AH.txt)
/// for more information. Here is some sample code of how to sign in:
///
/// ```
/// Auth auth = Auth();
/// await auth.initialize();
/// AuthMessage result = await signInWithEmail('student@hmc.edu', 'pass');
/// if (result.success) {
///   print('${auth.name} is signed in!');
/// } else {
///   print(result.errorMessage);
/// }
/// ```
