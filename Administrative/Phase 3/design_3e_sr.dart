/// This is a design document for the File Storage component of the HvZ App.
/// The File Storage component is responsible for uploading and downloading
/// mission files to and from the Firebase cloud storage (https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).
/// It also ensures that cached values are used when available rather than
/// downloading from file storage each time. The documentation for Flutter's
/// Firebase storage integration is here https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/storage/usage.
///
/// This component implements a single class called FileStorageService which is
/// called whenever any component needs to upload or download from the file storage.

/// Addressing Feedback:
///
/// 1. Feedback: the getCurrentGame() function is not in the specifications. The database
/// does not store the current game name, so it cannot be retrieved from the database.
///
/// Source: Alex Hadley
///
/// CHANGE APPROVED: The file storage cannot call a function that does not exist.
/// Instead, the newGame function has been modified in the specifications and
/// the design to take in a string with the current game name.
///
///
/// 2. Feedback: The [getMissionFiles] function from the specifications is never
/// called.
///
/// Source: Professor Kampe
///
/// CHANGE APPROVED: It is now called in the [downloadMissionFiles] function which
/// was added as part of the specification revisions. Its purpose is to conveniently
/// download all the files for a mission at once given that that is the main
/// reason file storage is a component.abstract
///
///
/// 3. Feedback: There is no way for the client to get a list of the files available
/// to be downloaded for the current mission.
///
/// Source: Professor Kampe
///
/// CHANGE REJECTED: This functionality is not necessary for the component to do
/// its job of downloading the correct mission files for a particular mission.
/// The paths of the mission files are already stored in the database, and they
/// are automatically retrieved by the [downloadMissionFiles] function. This
/// functionality may be helpful for testing whether something was uploaded correctly
/// (there are built in functions for this), but it is not necessary for the
/// component design.
///
///
/// 4. Feedback: Raw data is unclear as to what it means in the [newGame] function
/// and the [newMission] function.
///
/// Source: Alex Hadley
///
/// CHANGE ACCEPTED: This should be clear enough for an experienced programmer to
/// code after reading the design. It has been changed to say "any character" instead
/// of raw data.
///
///
/// 5. Feedback: You should handle file retrieval from the file stream in the
/// [downloadFile] function. Convert the file stream to a file rather than leave
/// it as a file stream. The filestream class variable does not seem like it has
/// a real purpose either.
///
/// Source: Alex Hadley
///
/// CHANGE ACCEPTED: The file storage component should do this and not leave the
/// work to the application to translate the file stream into something usable.
/// The File stream now is converted to a file, and the filestream class variable
/// has no use, so it has been removed.
///
///
/// 6. Feedback: Feedback: File storage component is not complex.
///
/// Source: Professor Kampe
///
/// CHANGE ACCEPTED: The file storage does not do enough complex behavior on its
/// own. The cache component was supposed to add complexity, but there was a library
/// that already took care of it. A new component, the Zombie Lineage component,
/// has been added to supplement the file storage component with complexity. This
/// component must keep track of the relationships between zombies like a data
/// structure. Cycling through the relationships between the different zombies
/// adds the complexity.
///
///
/// 7. Feedback: Rather than return String IDs for the Zombie Lineage component,
/// it seems easier to return [LineageUser] objects.
///
/// Source: Alex Hadley
///
/// CHANGE ACCEPTED: For the same reason the file storage was modified to return
/// files, this has been modified to return the lineage user objects which are
/// easier for the application to use than user IDs. From the lineage object,
/// the application can get information such as the player's name and the people
/// the player has tagged without needing to look it up in the database.
///
///
/// 8. Feedback: To make the component more interesting, you may want to add more
/// levels of depth for the zombie lineage.
///
/// Source: Alex Hadley
///
/// CHANGE ACCEPTED: This adds some more complexity to the component and allows
/// the users to be able to view more information at once.
