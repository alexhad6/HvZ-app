Review of Alex’s Authentication and Registration component


Specification
* No mention of the registration component in the overall description, only authentication
* Get functions such as name, ID, change user name
   * Where is this information being stored? 
   * In essence, where or what are these functions operating on?
* Is moderator status something the authentication needs to handle?


Design
* Everything seems good, but what does the connected function do for the component? It doesn’t 
	seem to be called anywhere. 
   * Is it necessary? 
   * Or should it be called by other functions during their routines?


Test Plan
* For auth returning an instance of auth test (2nd blackbox test), will there have been clean up 
	from the test before it? 
   * Will the previous instance of auth be deleted?
* Listener setup test is unclear
   * Calling a mock function doesn’t seem to have any purpose
* Is listener really a black box test? It seems to be something in the background rather than a 
	part of the specifications
* Email verified test
   * If user is signed in with google, do they still get a verification email?
   * If not, does email verified still need to be held true when signed in for every user?
* Test valid email and password signs in correctly
   * Logs out any signed in user
   * Shouldn’t this be done in another test as part of clean up?
* Should there be a feedcode already generated test?
   * Don’t want two people with the same feed code
* Overall comment
   * It seems like creating mocks for everything will add on a good amount of work. 
   * Can you do the same thing without the mocks?
