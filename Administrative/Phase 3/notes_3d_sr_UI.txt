Review of Matthew’s UI component


Specification


* The component role is clear to me
   * Do you have an idea of which libraries or technologies you will be using for the graphical user
	 interface?
* Complexity concern
   * Is simply displaying the data and using the interface to interact with different parts complex 
	enough for a whole component? It seems like a lot of work, but is anything complicated going 
	on?
* Very detailed QR code connection
   * Is there complexity to be found in this component?
   * What are the public methods to be called to transfer the data from the QR code part to the 
	database?
* There is no detail on the connection between the UI and the database
   * Only one function describing the interface with the database
* There is no detail on the connection between the UI and the file storage
   * No functions describing interface with the file storage
* There is no explanation of testing feasibility - is this testable?
