Phase 3 Postmortem

In this phase of the project, we divided up our application into four main components, based on the 
architecture. From there, we each individually researched, reviewed, and finalized our component’s 
specifications, design, and test plan. This was all done in preparation and with the expectation of being 
able to fully and successfully implement the component from these documents.

Below is a list of the things we learned, what worked well and what has room for growth in our process:


ARCHITECTURAL REFINEMENT AND PRELIMINARY COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS
* See preliminary specification notes: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q11xWyZkFI70qOUKm1BuQaQVMZva3qla6IKakMRD1pk/edit?usp=sharing 
* There was some confusion and difficulty at first in figuring out how to divide our components. We made 
a rough draft of component divisions, but we still had questions for Prof. Kampe. 
* Alex and Kyra met with Prof. Kampe and took notes on the conversation.
   * We probably should have done a better job of communicating everything we learned in the meeting to 
     Santiago and Matthew.
* Santiago was extremely sick this week which made it impossible to meet as an entire team to decide on 
  everything relating to component divisions.
* Alex and Kyra met and decided on preliminary component divisions without Santiago and Matthew. Santiago 
  and Matthew were unable to attend the meeting, which led to some confusion later in the project on the 
  exact definitions and the level of complexity of certain components.
* It was unfortunate that Santiago and Matthew couldn’t attend the meeting, but there was no way around it 
  for this week.
* The Friday meeting included a long discussion of the components because there was still some confusion 
  since not all were able to meet with Prof Kampe.
* There was a misunderstanding of the amount of flexibility there was to work on the “assigned” components
   * Components were not fully defined because it was up to the individual to define them. Not everyone 
     understood this.
   * There needed to be improved communication in terms of component flexibility - the ability to choose your 
     own component and define it such that you believed it was sufficient for the project.
   * Some had the expectations of running this phase like a team phase when it wasn’t a team phase.
      * People were still in the team mindset.
      * People should’ve taken more independent responsibilities.
      * Reading the entire phase explanation instead of just the 3.A description would have helped clarify the 
        importance of doing things on your own for this phase.
   * The members who had the chance to meet with Prof Kampe should’ve explained conclusions from the meeting 
     better to those who were unable to attend.
   * Non present members of the Prof. Kampe meeting should have had a meeting to  ask Prof. Kampe more 
     questions on their own.


SPECIFICATION DEVELOPMENT
* In general, we all looked back at the requirements from phase 1 and the architecture from phase 2 in order to 
  figure out what our components needed to do. The steps from the previous phases were a useful reference here.
* In this section, there could have been more respect for established group deadlines. Group collaboration was 
  needed in order to coordinate our specifications and designs. Since we decided that our designs would be done 
  by Saturday at 5 PM, Kyra finished and turned in her specs and design then, but Santiago and Alex still had 
  additional database requirements after the deadline. This shouldn’t have happened — Alex and Santiago should 
  have either rescheduled the deadline beforehand or respected the deadline.
* Matthew described a snowballing effect that caused him difficulty in this part of the project. The problems 
  of the first week in terms of clarification blended into this week, which caused some issues developing these 
  specifications. This class got put on hold, due to workload from other classes. This is okay because this 
  semester can be very overwhelming, but unfortunately there were consequences for this class. 


DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPONENT DESIGNS
* For all of us, design was particularly time consuming. Because Dart was a new language and none of had used 
  Firebase libraries before, we had to both learn enough to know what was feasible and design the functionality 
  of our components.
   * In retrospect, it might have been easier to design our components using a language we already knew; however, 
     we also had to spend time learning about the necessary libraries and APIs (for Flutter and Firebase), so the 
     time spent on learning was not completely avoidable.
* Kyra did a lot of research into FlutterFire Cloud Firestore in order to design the database component, as well 
  as learn enough about Dart and Flutter in order to write accurate pseudo code. This took a lot of time.
* Alex did some prototyping in Flutter before designing the authentication component, whereas others only read 
  documentation and examples. Writing working programs using Flutter and Firebase helped a lot with understanding 
  the language and what was feasible. It took a bit of time to get everything working, but it really helped in 
  the design and in reviewing other people’s components.
* Matthew had some more trouble designing his component because the specifications from the previous week were not 
  complete enough to move into design.
* If we were on a real software development team (outside of school), it would have been helpful for us to have some 
  sort of Flutter learning phase or mob programming on prototypes. But as we have other classes and things taking up 
  our time, this wasn’t possible for all of us.


DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEST PLANS
* We had a brief meeting with Prof. Kampe to discuss the distinction between white box and black box testing.
   * Kyra found this information particularly helpful in organizing her test plan.
* Kyra found that the test plan took a lot of work and was time consuming. At least because of the sheer amount of 
  tests required to feel like she had good coverage. 
* Santiago definitely pushed this off (for reasons unknown even to himself). He wrote one test case.
* Alex also found this section to be time consuming. He had to write many test cases to cover all of the cases and 
  functionality of the authentication component, which was time consuming.


THE REVIEW PROCESS AND THE RESULTING DESIGN/PLAN CHANGES
* Kyra found her review process with Alex granted a lot more insight into how Flutter works and a stronger direction 
  in which to look towards during solo revisions. There was good communication and organization. While there was one 
  unavoidable scheduling difficulty for an interview this ended up not being that inconvenient.
* Alex found his reviews from Kyra and Santiago helpful. From his meetings, he was able to more clearly state his 
  design and clarify the authentication process to other group members.
* Santiago and Matthew needed more communication on where the other was at during this point. 
* Santiago scheduled with Alex to get a review for his component. 


THE PLANNING AND ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THESE ACTIVITIES
* We still had weekly group check-ins (every Monday and Friday), even though the project was much more individual than 
  previous phases. We found this helpful because it still helped give us a space to collaborate as a group and see the 
  bigger picture of the product we are trying to create together. It also gave us a space to ask questions and develop 
  group expectations each week.
* Santiago would’ve liked to try daily meetings during this individualistic phase. This would’ve improved communication 
  between members of the group and created a space to ask smaller, more detailed questions. However, other members of 
  the team noted that they tend to do all the work in one day, so they wouldn’t have found daily check-ins super helpful. 
  Perhaps, in an ideal world where we are all only taking this class and it is all our top priority, this would be a 
  good system to put in place. However, given the current situation, this is not feasible. 
* Kyra expressed that she used her management plan a lot more with the individualized workload, because she was able to 
  specialize it more and it was a very useful tool to have around. 


THE OVERALL PROJECT AS AN EDUCATIONAL EXERCISE
* Overall we learned a lot from having to apply new technologies to our components. This was especially challenging 
  because of the individual nature of our work in this project.
* Additionally, our project taught us that while at surface level our app may appear simple, but the functionality, 
  planning, and overall design required intensive work.
* Lastly, this phase required a lot of time, coordination, and effort; so it was difficult to get the most out of the 
  assignments while balancing work from other classes. We each found this project incredibly challenging in different 
  ways. However, nonetheless, we all did our best.
